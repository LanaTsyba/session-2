    <h3><strong>Les Paroles</strong></h3>
    <p>Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,<br/>
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe<br/>
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,<br/>
Possessing and caressing me.<br/>
Jai guru deva om<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/><br/>

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,<br/>
That call me on and on across the universe,<br/>
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they<br/>
Tumble blindly as they make their way<br/>
Across the universe<br/>
Jai guru deva om<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/><br/>

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing<br/>
Through my open views inciting and inviting me<br/>
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a<br/>
million suns, it calls me on and on<br/>
Across the universe<br/>
Jai guru deva om<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br/><br/>
